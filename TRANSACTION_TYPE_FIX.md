# Transaction Type Mapping Fix

## Issue Summary

The application had incorrect transaction type mappings that caused `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable` when trying to view book details.

## Root Cause

The transaction types were incorrectly mapped in multiple functions:

### Incorrect Mapping (Before Fix)

- `transaction_type = 1` → `available_for_exchange` ❌
- `transaction_type = 2` → `available_for_borrowing` ❌
- `transaction_type = 3` → `available_for_buying` ❌

### Correct Mapping (After Fix)

- `transaction_type = 1` → `available_for_borrowing` ✅ (Lending/Borrowing)
- `transaction_type = 2` → `available_for_buying` ✅ (Selling/Buying)
- `transaction_type = 3` → `available_for_exchange` ✅ (Exchange)

## Functions Fixed

1. **`ubook_page()`** - Book detail viewing
2. **`my_books()`** - User's book listing
3. **`add_book2()`** - Adding new books
4. **`edit_book()`** - Editing existing books

## Error Resolution

- Added null checks for database queries
- Fixed transaction type mapping across all functions
- Added proper error handling for missing transaction details

## Testing

The fix resolves the error when accessing `/book/3` and ensures proper data retrieval for all transaction types.
